**Course Name:** Business Data Management  
**Timeline:** January 2025 â€“ April 2025

## Business Problems Addressed
1. **Minimizing accumulation of dead stock**  
2. **Reducing product breakage during transportation**

## Data Collection & Analysis

2. **Implement inventory-tracking software** to monitor stock levels in real time.
3. **Adopt robust packaging techniques** to ensure the safety of goods during transit.
4. **Introduce a breakage log** system to track and analyze transit-related issues.
5. **Diversify transportation modes** by incorporating air and railway logistics instead of relying solely on road transport.
